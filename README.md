# Hotel Management System Database Project

## Details

A hotel comprises numerous operations such as front office, booking and reservation, inventory, material management, quality management, security, energy management, housekeeping, CRM, and more.

A hotel can be part of different Hotel Chains, each of which may have multiple hotels. Each hotel contains multiple rooms and floors, with rooms available in different types. Each room type has its own price and description. A hotel employs staff to manage the services provided to customers. Customers can book rooms either online or by cash payment at the hotel.

Guest records are stored in the hotel database, containing customer identity, address, check-in time, check-out time, etc.
